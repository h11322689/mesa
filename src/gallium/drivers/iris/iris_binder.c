   * @file iris_binder.c
   *
   * Shader programs refer to most resources via integer handles.  These are
   * indexes (BTIs) into a "Binding Table", which is simply a list of pointers
   * to SURFACE_STATE entries.  Each shader stage has its own binding table,
   * set by the 3DSTATE_BINDING_TABLE_POINTERS_* commands.  We stream out
   * binding tables dynamically, storing them in special BOs we call "binders."
   *
   * Unfortunately, the hardware designers made 3DSTATE_BINDING_TABLE_POINTERS
   * only accept a 16-bit pointer.  This means that all binding tables have to
   * live within the 64kB range starting at Surface State Base Address.  (The
   * actual SURFACE_STATE entries can live anywhere in the 4GB zone, as the
   * binding table entries are full 32-bit pointers.)
   *
   * To handle this, we split a 4GB region of VMA into two memory zones.
   * IRIS_MEMZONE_BINDER is a 1GB region at the bottom able to hold a few
   * binder BOs.  IRIS_MEMZONE_SURFACE contains the rest of the 4GB, and is
   * always at a higher address than the binders.  This allows us to program
   * Surface State Base Address to the binder BO's address, and offset the
   * values in the binding table to account for the base not starting at the
   * beginning of the 4GB region.
   *
   * This does mean that we have to emit STATE_BASE_ADDRESS and stall when
   * we run out of space in the binder, which hopefully won't happen too often.
