   * Liveness analysis is based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_variable_analysis
   * This implementation calculates liveness for each instruction.
   * The liveness set in this implementation is defined as the set of
   * registers live before the instruction executes.
   * Blocks/instructions/ops are iterated backwards so register reads are
   * propagated up to the instruction that writes it.
   *
   * 1) Before computing liveness for an instruction, propagate liveness
   *    from the next instruction. If it is the last instruction in a
   *    block, propagate liveness from all possible next instructions in
   *    the successor blocks.
   * 2) Calculate the live set for the instruction. The initial live set
   *    is a propagated set of the live set from the next instructions.
   *    - Registers which aren't touched by this instruction are kept
   *    intact.
   *    - If a register is written by this instruction, it no longer needs
   *    to be live before the instruction, so it is removed from the live
   *    set of that instruction.
   *    - If a register is read by this instruction, it needs to be live
   *    before its execution, so add it to its live set.
   *    - Non-ssa registers are a special case. For this, the algorithm
   *    keeps and updates the mask of live components following the same
   *    logic as above. The register is only removed from the live set of
   *    the instruction when no live components are left.
   *    - If a non-ssa register is written and read in the same
   *    instruction, it stays in the live set.
   *    - Another special case is when a register is only written and read
   *    within a single instruciton. In this case a register needs to be
   *    reserved but not propagated. The algorithm adds it to the
   *    live_internal set so that the register allocator properly assigns
   *    an interference for it.
   * 3) The algorithm must run over the entire program until it converges,
   *    i.e. a full run happens without changes. This is because blocks
   *    are updated sequentially and updates in a block may need to be
   *    propagated to parent blocks that were already calculated in the
   *    current run.
