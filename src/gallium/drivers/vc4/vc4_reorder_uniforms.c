   * After optimization has occurred, rewrites the shader to have uniform reads
   * reading from the c->uniform_contents[] in order, exactly once each.
   *
   * This allows optimization and instruction scheduling to move things around
   * without worrying about how the hardware has the "each uniform read bumps
   * the uniform read address" property.
