   *     for SPIR-V shaders (at least for the first version), however we
   *     are left with specifying how it should "not work". The primary
   *     issue is that SPIR-V binaries are not required to have names
   *     associated with variables. They can be associated in debug
   *     information, but there is no requirement for that to be present,
   *     and it should not be relied upon."
   *
   *     Options:"
   *
   *     <skip>
   *
   *     "RESOLVED.  Pick (c), but also allow debug names to be returned
   *      if an implementation wants to."
   *
   * So names are considered optional debug info, so the linker needs to
   * work without them, and returning them is optional. For simplicity at
   * this point we are ignoring names
