   * Rebalances a reduction expression tree.
   *
   * For reduction operations (e.g., x + y + z + w) we generate an expression
   * tree like
   *
   *        +
   *       / \
   *      +   w
   *     / \
   *    +   z
   *   / \
   *  x   y
   *
   * which we can rebalance into
   *
   *       +
   *      / \
   *     /   \
   *    +     +
   *   / \   / \
   *  x   y z   w
   *
   * to get a better instruction scheduling.
   *
   * See "Tree Rebalancing in Optimal Editor Time and Space" by Quentin F. Stout
   * and Bette L. Warren.
   *
   * Also see http://penguin.ewu.edu/~trolfe/DSWpaper/ for a very readable
   * explanation of the of the tree_to_vine() (rightward rotation) and
   * vine_to_tree() (leftward rotation) algorithms.
