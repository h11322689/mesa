      /**
   * Attempt to reassociate and optimize some combinations of bfi instructions.
   *
   * Many shaders will use a sequence of bfi instructions to build complex
   * bitfields.  Sequences in real shaders look like:
   *
   *    bfi(A, B, bfi(C, D, 0))
   *
   * Let A and C be constants,
   *
   *    (A & (B << find_lsb(A)) | (~A & bfi(C, D, 0))
   *
   * If find_lsb(A) = 0 (i.e., A is odd), then
   *
   *    (A & B) | (~A & bfi(C, D, 0))
   *    (A & B) | (~A & ((D << find_lsb(C)) & C) | (0 & ~C))
   *    (A & B) | (~A & ((D << find_lsb(C)) & C))
   *    (A & B) | ((D << find_lsb(C)) & (~A & C))
   *
   * If A and C are completely disjoint, that is (A & C) == 0, then (~A & C) == C
   *
   *    (A & B) | ((D << find_lsb(C)) & C)
   *
   * If A and C are completely disjoint, then A & ~C == A
   *
   *    (~C & (A & B)) | ((D << find_lsb(C)) & C)
   *    bfi(C, D, A & B)
   *
   * On some architectures, bfi instructions cannot use immediate values as
   * sources, so the constants A, C, and 0 would have to be loaded into
   * registers.  After reassociation, only C must be loaded into a register.
   * This saves instructions and register pressure.
   *
   * Ideally this would be implemented as an algebraic optimization, but there
   * is no way to enforce the requirement that (A & C) == 0.
