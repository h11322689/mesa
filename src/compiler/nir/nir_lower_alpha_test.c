   * Implements GL alpha testing by comparing the output color's alpha to the
   * alpha_ref intrinsic and emitting a discard based on it.
   *
   * The alpha_to_one value overrides the source alpha to 1.0 to implement
   * GL_SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_ONE, which applies before the alpha test (and would be
   * rather silly to use with alpha test, but the spec permits).
