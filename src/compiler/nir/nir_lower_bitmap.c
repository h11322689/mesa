      /* Lower glBitmap().
   *
   * This is based on the logic in st_get_bitmap_shader() in TGSI compiler.
   * From st_cb_bitmap.c:
   *
   *    glBitmaps are drawn as textured quads.  The user's bitmap pattern
   *    is stored in a texture image.  An alpha8 texture format is used.
   *    The fragment shader samples a bit (texel) from the texture, then
   *    discards the fragment if the bit is off.
   *
   *    Note that we actually store the inverse image of the bitmap to
   *    simplify the fragment program.  An "on" bit gets stored as texel=0x0
   *    and an "off" bit is stored as texel=0xff.  Then we kill the
   *    fragment if the negated texel value is less than zero.
   *
   * Note that the texture format will be, according to what driver supports,
   * in order of preference (with swizzle):
   *
   *    I8_UNORM - .xxxx
   *    A8_UNORM - .000x
   *    L8_UNORM - .xxx1
   *
   * If L8_UNORM, options->swizzle_xxxx is true.  Otherwise we can just use
   * the .w comp.
   *
   * Run before nir_lower_io.
