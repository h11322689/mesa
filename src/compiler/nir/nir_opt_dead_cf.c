   * This file implements an optimization that deletes statically
   * unreachable/dead code. In NIR, one way this can happen is when an if
   * statement has a constant condition:
   *
   * if (true) {
   *    ...
   * }
   *
   * We delete the if statement and paste the contents of the always-executed
   * branch into the surrounding control flow, possibly removing more code if
   * the branch had a jump at the end.
   *
   * Another way is that control flow can end in a jump so that code after it
   * never gets executed. In particular, this can happen after optimizing
   * something like:
   *
   * if (true) {
   *    ...
   *    break;
   * }
   * ...
   *
   * We also consider the case where both branches of an if end in a jump, e.g.:
   *
   * if (...) {
   *    break;
   * } else {
   *    continue;
   * }
   * ...
   *
   * Finally, we also handle removing useless loops and ifs, i.e. loops and ifs
   * with no side effects and without any definitions that are used
   * elsewhere. This case is a little different from the first two in that the
   * code is actually run (it just never does anything), but there are similar
   * issues with needing to be careful with restarting after deleting the
   * cf_node (see dead_cf_list()) so this is a convenient place to remove them.
