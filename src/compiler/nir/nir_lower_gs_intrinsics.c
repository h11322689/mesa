   *
   * Geometry Shaders can call EmitVertex()/EmitStreamVertex() to output an
   * arbitrary number of vertices.  However, the shader must declare the maximum
   * number of vertices that it will ever output - further attempts to emit
   * vertices result in undefined behavior according to the GLSL specification.
   *
   * Drivers might use this maximum number of vertices to allocate enough space
   * to hold the geometry shader's output.  Some drivers (such as i965) need to
   * implement "safety checks" which ensure that the shader hasn't emitted too
   * many vertices, to avoid overflowing that space and trashing other memory.
   *
   * The count of emitted vertices can also be useful in buffer offset
   * calculations, so drivers know where to write the GS output.
   *
   * However, for simple geometry shaders that emit a statically determinable
   * number of vertices, this extra bookkeeping is unnecessary and inefficient.
   * By tracking the vertex count in NIR, we allow constant folding/propagation
   * and dead control flow optimizations to eliminate most of it where possible.
   *
   * This pass introduces a new global variable which stores the current vertex
   * count (initialized to 0), and converts emit_vertex/end_primitive intrinsics
   * to their *_with_counter variants.  emit_vertex is also wrapped in a safety
   * check to avoid buffer overflows.  Finally, it adds a set_vertex_count
   * intrinsic at the end of the program, informing the driver of the final
   * vertex count.
