   * Periodic OA samples are read() into these buffer structures via the
   * i915 perf kernel interface and appended to the
   * perf_ctx->sample_buffers linked list. When we process the
   * results of an OA metrics query we need to consider all the periodic
   * samples between the Begin and End MI_REPORT_PERF_COUNT command
   * markers.
   *
   * 'Periodic' is a simplification as there are other automatic reports
   * written by the hardware also buffered here.
   *
   * Considering three queries, A, B and C:

   *                ________________A_________________
   *                |                                |
   *                | ________B_________ _____C___________
   *                | |                | |           |   |
   *
   * And an illustration of sample buffers read over this time frame:
   * [HEAD ][     ][     ][     ][     ][     ][     ][     ][TAIL ]
   *
   * These nodes may hold samples for query A:
   * [     ][     ][  A  ][  A  ][  A  ][  A  ][  A  ][     ][     ]
   *
   * These nodes may hold samples for query B:
   * [     ][     ][  B  ][  B  ][  B  ][     ][     ][     ][     ]
   *
   * These nodes may hold samples for query C:
   * [     ][     ][     ][     ][     ][  C  ][  C  ][  C  ][     ]
   *
   * The illustration assumes we have an even distribution of periodic
   * samples so all nodes have the same size plotted against time:
   *
   * Note, to simplify code, the list is never empty.
   *
   * With overlapping queries we can see that periodic OA reports may
   * relate to multiple queries and care needs to be take to keep
   * track of sample buffers until there are no queries that might
   * depend on their contents.
   *
   * We use a node ref counting system where a reference ensures that a
   * node and all following nodes can't be freed/recycled until the
   * reference drops to zero.
   *
   * E.g. with a ref of one here:
   * [  0  ][  0  ][  1  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ]
   *
   * These nodes could be freed or recycled ("reaped"):
   * [  0  ][  0  ]
   *
   * These must be preserved until the leading ref drops to zero:
   *               [  1  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ]
   *
   * When a query starts we take a reference on the current tail of
   * the list, knowing that no already-buffered samples can possibly
   * relate to the newly-started query. A pointer to this node is
   * also saved in the query object's ->oa.samples_head.
   *
   * E.g. starting query A while there are two nodes in .sample_buffers:
   *                ________________A________
   *                |
   *
   * [  0  ][  1  ]
   *           ^_______ Add a reference and store pointer to node in
   *                    A->oa.samples_head
   *
   * Moving forward to when the B query starts with no new buffer nodes:
   * (for reference, i915 perf reads() are only done when queries finish)
   *                ________________A_______
   *                | ________B___
   *                | |
   *
   * [  0  ][  2  ]
   *           ^_______ Add a reference and store pointer to
   *                    node in B->oa.samples_head
   *
   * Once a query is finished, after an OA query has become 'Ready',
   * once the End OA report has landed and after we we have processed
   * all the intermediate periodic samples then we drop the
   * ->oa.samples_head reference we took at the start.
   *
   * So when the B query has finished we have:
   *                ________________A________
   *                | ______B___________
   *                | |                |
   * [  0  ][  1  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ]
   *           ^_______ Drop B->oa.samples_head reference
   *
   * We still can't free these due to the A->oa.samples_head ref:
   *        [  1  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ]
   *
   * When the A query finishes: (note there's a new ref for C's samples_head)
   *                ________________A_________________
   *                |                                |
   *                |                    _____C_________
   *                |                    |           |
   * [  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  0  ][  1  ][  0  ][  0  ]
   *           ^_______ Drop A->oa.samples_head reference
   *
   * And we can now reap these nodes up to the C->oa.samples_head:
   * [  X  ][  X  ][  X  ][  X  ]
   *                  keeping -> [  1  ][  0  ][  0  ]
   *
   * We reap old sample buffers each time we finish processing an OA
   * query by iterating the sample_buffers list from the head until we
   * find a referenced node and stop.
   *
   * Reaped buffers move to a perfquery.free_sample_buffers list and
   * when we come to read() we first look to recycle a buffer from the
   * free_sample_buffers list before allocating a new buffer.

   * units (such as the EUs running shaders) that the performance counters are
   * associated with.
   *
   * The intention of performance queries is to measure the work associated
   * with commands between the begin/end delimiters and so for that to be the
   * case we need to explicitly synchronize the parsing of commands to capture
   * Begin/End counter snapshots with what's running across other parts of the
   * GPU.
   *
   * When the command parser reaches a Begin marker it effectively needs to
   * drain everything currently running on the GPU until the hardware is idle
   * before capturing the first snapshot of counters - otherwise the results
   * would also be measuring the effects of earlier commands.
   *
   * When the command parser reaches an End marker it needs to stall until
   * everything currently running on the GPU has finished before capturing the
   * end snapshot - otherwise the results won't be a complete representation
   * of the work.
   *
   * To achieve this, we stall the pipeline at pixel scoreboard (prevent any
   * additional work to be processed by the pipeline until all pixels of the
   * previous draw has be completed).
   *
   * N.B. The final results are based on deltas of counters between (inside)
   * Begin/End markers so even though the total wall clock time of the
   * workload is stretched by larger pipeline bubbles the bubbles themselves
   * are generally invisible to the query results. Whether that's a good or a
   * bad thing depends on the use case. For a lower real-time impact while
   * capturing metrics then periodic sampling may be a better choice than
   * INTEL_performance_query.
