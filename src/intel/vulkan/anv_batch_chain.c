      /** Allocate a binding table
   *
   * This function allocates a binding table.  This is a bit more complicated
   * than one would think due to a combination of Vulkan driver design and some
   * unfortunate hardware restrictions.
   *
   * The 3DSTATE_BINDING_TABLE_POINTERS_* packets only have a 16-bit field for
   * the binding table pointer which means that all binding tables need to live
   * in the bottom 64k of surface state base address.  The way the GL driver has
   * classically dealt with this restriction is to emit all surface states
   * on-the-fly into the batch and have a batch buffer smaller than 64k.  This
   * isn't really an option in Vulkan for a couple of reasons:
   *
   *  1) In Vulkan, we have growing (or chaining) batches so surface states have
   *     to live in their own buffer and we have to be able to re-emit
   *     STATE_BASE_ADDRESS as needed which requires a full pipeline stall.  In
   *     order to avoid emitting STATE_BASE_ADDRESS any more often than needed
   *     (it's not that hard to hit 64k of just binding tables), we allocate
   *     surface state objects up-front when VkImageView is created.  In order
   *     for this to work, surface state objects need to be allocated from a
   *     global buffer.
   *
   *  2) We tried to design the surface state system in such a way that it's
   *     already ready for bindless texturing.  The way bindless texturing works
   *     on our hardware is that you have a big pool of surface state objects
   *     (with its own state base address) and the bindless handles are simply
   *     offsets into that pool.  With the architecture we chose, we already
   *     have that pool and it's exactly the same pool that we use for regular
   *     surface states so we should already be ready for bindless.
   *
   *  3) For render targets, we need to be able to fill out the surface states
   *     later in vkBeginRenderPass so that we can assign clear colors
   *     correctly.  One way to do this would be to just create the surface
   *     state data and then repeatedly copy it into the surface state BO every
   *     time we have to re-emit STATE_BASE_ADDRESS.  While this works, it's
   *     rather annoying and just being able to allocate them up-front and
   *     re-use them for the entire render pass.
   *
   * While none of these are technically blockers for emitting state on the fly
   * like we do in GL, the ability to have a single surface state pool is
   * simplifies things greatly.  Unfortunately, it comes at a cost...
   *
   * Because of the 64k limitation of 3DSTATE_BINDING_TABLE_POINTERS_*, we can't
   * place the binding tables just anywhere in surface state base address.
   * Because 64k isn't a whole lot of space, we can't simply restrict the
   * surface state buffer to 64k, we have to be more clever.  The solution we've
   * chosen is to have a block pool with a maximum size of 2G that starts at
   * zero and grows in both directions.  All surface states are allocated from
   * the top of the pool (positive offsets) and we allocate blocks (< 64k) of
   * binding tables from the bottom of the pool (negative offsets).  Every time
   * we allocate a new binding table block, we set surface state base address to
   * point to the bottom of the binding table block.  This way all of the
   * binding tables in the block are in the bottom 64k of surface state base
   * address.  When we fill out the binding table, we add the distance between
   * the bottom of our binding table block and zero of the block pool to the
   * surface state offsets so that they are correct relative to out new surface
   * state base address at the bottom of the binding table block.
   *
   * \param[in]  entries        The number of surface state entries the binding
   *                            table should be able to hold.
   *
   * \param[out] state_offset   The offset surface surface state base address
   *                            where the surface states live.  This must be
   *                            added to the surface state offset when it is
   *                            written into the binding table entry.
