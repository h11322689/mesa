   /* anv Virtual Memory Layout
    * =========================
    *
    * When the anv driver is determining the virtual graphics addresses of
    * memory objects itself using the softpin mechanism, the following memory
    * ranges will be used.
    *
    * Three special considerations to notice:
    *
    * (1) the dynamic state pool is located within the same 4 GiB as the low
    * heap. This is to work around a VF cache issue described in a comment in
    * anv_physical_device_init_heaps.
    *
    * (2) the binding table pool is located at lower addresses than the BT
    * (binding table) surface state pool, within a 4 GiB range which also
    * contains the bindless surface state pool. This allows surface state base
    * addresses to cover both binding tables (16 bit offsets), the internal
    * surface states (32 bit offsets) and the bindless surface states.
    *
    * (3) the last 4 GiB of the address space is withheld from the high heap.
    * Various hardware units will read past the end of an object for various
    * reasons. This healthy margin prevents reads from wrapping around 48-bit
    * addresses.
