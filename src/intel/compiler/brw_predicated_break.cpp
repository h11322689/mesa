   * Loops are often structured as
   *
   * loop:
   *    CMP.f0
   *    (+f0) IF
   *    BREAK
   *    ENDIF
   *    ...
   *    WHILE loop
   *
   * This peephole pass removes the IF and ENDIF instructions and predicates the
   * BREAK, dropping two instructions from the loop body.
   *
   * If the loop was a DO { ... } WHILE loop, it looks like
   *
   * loop:
   *    ...
   *    CMP.f0
   *    (+f0) IF
   *    BREAK
   *    ENDIF
   *    WHILE loop
   *
   * and we can remove the BREAK instruction and predicate the WHILE.
