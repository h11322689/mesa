   * @file brw_vue_map.c
   *
   * This file computes the "VUE map" for a (non-fragment) shader stage, which
   * describes the layout of its output varyings.  The VUE map is used to match
   * outputs from one stage with the inputs of the next.
   *
   * Largely, varyings can be placed however we like - producers/consumers simply
   * have to agree on the layout.  However, there is also a "VUE Header" that
   * prescribes a fixed-layout for items that interact with fixed function
   * hardware, such as the clipper and rasterizer.
