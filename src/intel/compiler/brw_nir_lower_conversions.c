       * such case is 0x40ee6a0000000001, which should round to 0x7b9b, but
       * going through float first turns into 0x7b9a instead. This is because
       * the first non-fitting bit is set, so we get a tie, but with the least
       * significant bit of the original number set, the tie should break
       * rounding up. The cast to float, however, turns into 0x47735000, which
       * when going to half still ties, but now we lost the tie-up bit, and
       * instead we round to the nearest even, which in this case is down.
       *
       * To fix this, we check if the original would have tied, and if the tie
       * would have rounded up, and if both are true, set the least
       * significant bit of the intermediate float to 1, so that a tie on the
       * next cast rounds up as well. If the rounding already got rid of the
       * tie, that set bit will just be truncated anyway and the end result
       * doesn't change.
       *
       * Another failing case is 0x40effdffffffffff. This one doesn't have the
       * tie from double to half, so it just rounds down to 0x7bff (65504.0),
       * but going through float first, it turns into 0x477ff000, which does
       * have the tie bit for half set, and when that one gets rounded it
       * turns into 0x7c00 (Infinity).
       * The fix for that one is to make sure the intermediate float does not
       * have the tie bit set if the original didn't have it.
       *
       * For the RTZ case, we don't need to do anything, as the intermediate
       * float should be ok already.
