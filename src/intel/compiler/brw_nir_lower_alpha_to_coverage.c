   * We need to compute alpha to coverage dithering manually in shader
   * and replace sample mask store with the bitwise-AND of sample mask and
   * alpha to coverage dithering.
   *
   * The following formula is used to compute final sample mask:
   *  m = int(16.0 * clamp(src0_alpha, 0.0, 1.0))
   *  dither_mask = 0x1111 * ((0xfea80 >> (m & ~3)) & 0xf) |
   *     0x0808 * (m & 2) | 0x0100 * (m & 1)
   *  sample_mask = sample_mask & dither_mask
   *
   * It gives a number of ones proportional to the alpha for 2, 4, 8 or 16
   * least significant bits of the result:
   *  0.0000 0000000000000000
   *  0.0625 0000000100000000
